# stupid-rss-reader

I'm tired of different stupid RSS clients and I created own Stupid RSS Reader.

Try it [here](https://gurov.github.io/stupid-rss-reader/)

## Features
* Stupid RSS Reader is [Progressive Web Apps](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/);
* Very simple;
* Offline mode;
* All user data are stored locally only;
* Open source.
